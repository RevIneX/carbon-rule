# CARBON-RULE  
> **over-engineered system is one stone chip away from collapse**  

### **A ARCHITECTS CREED**  
**`|`** WE BUILD SYSTEMS.    
**`|`** SOME ARE FRAGILE.  
**`|`** SOME ARE ROBUST.  
**`|`** THIS IS A WARNING AGAINST A SPECIFIC KIND OF FRAGILITY: **THE FRAGILITY OF PERFECTION**  

### **THE RULE STATES**  
**`|`** a system optimized to an extreme — for minimal weight, maximum speed, or theoretical purity — becomes brittle.   
**`|`** its integrity depends on an ideal, controlled environment.   
**`|`** the moment it encounters an unplanned, real-world imperfection (a corrupted packet, a malformed input). 
**`|`** its complex, interdependent structure can fail catastrophically.   
**`|`** its does not bend; it shatters.  

### **THIS IS NOT AN ARGUMENT AGAINST ADVANCED ENGINEERING**   
**`|`** it is an argument for CONTEXT.   
**`|`** carbon fiber is a marvel on a smooth racetrack.   
**`|`** it is a liability on a gravel road.   
**`|`** always know your road.  

### **THEREFORE: OPTIMIZE LAST**  
**`|`** what works, works. do not shatter it for theoretical gains.  
**`|`** this is the wisdom of `KISS`  
**`|`** this is the discipline of `YAGNI`  
**`|`** perfection is not a starting point.   
**`|`** it is a final, careful adjustment if the road demands it.  

### **CHOOSE YOUR MATERIALS WISELY**  
**`|`** sometimes, the resilient, repairable, and understood solution (aluminum, steel, a simple script)   
**`|`** is superior to the exotic, optimized, and fragile one.   
**`|`** reliability often beats peak performance.  

### **THIS REPOSITORY IS THE RULE**   
**`|`** it contains no code, only the principle.   
**`|`** it is a mental tool.   
**`|`** use it to question complexity.   
**`|`** use it to choose robustness.
